**SUNBURST**

**Information**
<br>
Open Source Context is sharing the Passive DNS data from the IoC domains which have been generally attributed to SUNBURST.

**Notes**
<br>

- Domains like zupertech[.]com were previously registered domains which expired and were purchased by domain resellers. There have been a number of attacks inrecent years which took over abandoned domain and/or browser plugins and used their "established nature" to help decrease scrutiny. OSC recommends increasing srcutiny of domains which have been previously assigned to the nameserver of a reseller.
